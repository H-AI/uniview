# Plotly Dash

https://dash.plotly.com/

Dash applications are made up of 2 building blocks:

1. Layout
2. Callbacks


Layout describes the look and feel of the app, it defines the elements such as graphs, dropdowns, and the placement size, color, etc. 

Callbacks are used to bring interactiveltity to the dash applications.
