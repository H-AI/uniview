# Plotly Dash

https://dash.plotly.com/

Dash applications are made up of 2 building blocks:

1. Layout: Layout describes the look and feel of the app, it defines the elements such as graphs, dropdowns, and the placement size, color, etc.
2. Callbacks: Callbacks are used to bring interactiveltity to the dash applications.

## Study notes:

With `app.run_server(debug=True)`, Dash will automatically refresh your browser when you make a change in your code.
