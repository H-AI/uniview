The original uniview codes had been merged to ML repo. From now on, this repo will be my focused study repo. I presently have `Dash` development work.

Today, I also add study project for `fiftyone`. For ENV, since `fiftyone` depends on plotly (>=4.14, <5), I uninstalled `plotly` 5.4 in order to install `fiftyone`.

Also comment out all `dash` related packages.
